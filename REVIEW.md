# Project Review

Overall a vary interesting project where I learned new things, and reviewd some other stuff. in particular it was my first time using github issues, and Unity tests.

The LevelManeger script is responsible for: pausing the game, updating the score, saving the score, and bringing up the GameOver screen and pause screen.

The CreatingPlatforms script is where we can tune the platform speed the instantiate rate and the difficulty rate (the difficulty rate is the amount if increase in difficulty through time). also there is a json file in the assets folder called Initial parameters, where we can tune these parameters also there. The longer the game lasts the more difficult the game becomes.

The highscore gets saved, and the score will change its color when it passes the highscore to give the player the feedback. and also I have added a button in the Menu screen to reset the high score if needed.

I have made the game a little more pretier by changing the lighting, adding a light to the character, and giving the character a red trail. I deffinetely could make the game more pretier if I had more time.

The only issue I had was with writing unity tests, because I am new to the concept and it took me awhile to wrap my head around it, I still need to improve alot in this area. I managed to write a simple play test script where it tests if there is a player character available in the scene.

In totall I maybe spend around 12 hours on the project, the first 6 hourse was where I managed to build the core game, and the next 6 hours I spend working on making the game pretier, smooth level transitions, adding better menus, adding the initial parameters json file, and finally adding unity tests. and I have deffinately enjoyed the process.
